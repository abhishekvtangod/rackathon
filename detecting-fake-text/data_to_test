1.   raw_text = "The following is a transcript from The Guardian's interview with the British ambassador to the UN, John Baird. Baird: The situation in Syria is very dire. We have a number of reports of chemical weapons being used in the country. The Syrian opposition has expressed their willingness to use chemical weapons. We have a number of people who have been killed, many of them civilians. I think it is important to understand this. There are many who are saying that the chemical weapons used in Syria are not only used to destroy people but also to destroy the Syrian people. The Syrian people have been suffering for many years. The regime is responsible for that suffering. They have been using chemical weapons. They have killed many people, and they continue to kill many more. I think that the international community has to take a position that the Assad regime has a responsibility for that suffering. It must take a stand that we are not going to allow the Syrian government to use chemical weapons on civilians, that we are not going to allow them, and that we do not condone their use. We have a lot of people who believe that the regime is responsible for this suffering, and that they are responsible for this suffering, and that they are responsible for the use of chemical weapons. I think that we need to be clear about that. We must be clear that the use of chemical weapons by any country, including Russia and Iran, is a violation of international law. We are not going to tolerate that. We do not tolerate that. And we have the responsibility to ensure that the world doesn't allow the Assad regime to use chemical weapons against civilians."

2. I've been a gamer for over ten years. During that time, I've been involved in a number of games, and I've seen very few of them in the history of the company. My first foray into this was as a member of the U.S. Army. I played some of the games I liked from the early 1980s through the early 1990s, but my first foray into the hobby was at the beginning of 2000 when I was stationed in Afghanistan. After I got back to my hometown and went to school, I started playing games. I began playing multiplayer games, which was a very popular form of gaming. One of the games I started playing was the first-person shooter "The Wolf Among Us" which is still the best-selling title of all time.

I was at the beginning of the game development process. I had already seen a few demos of the game. I was also very interested in the multiplayer aspects of the game, and I wanted to see what the players would do in the game. In the beginning, I didn't know about multiplayer. I thought it would be cool to have some sort of "party game" with some kind of "game mode" which would give the player a real advantage. But as time went on, I realized that there were a lot of different things I wanted to create. To make it fun for the player, the multiplayer component was added.

I started playing the game as a member of the U.S. Army. When I returned to my hometown, I found myself in the middle of a war with a group of Taliban soldiers. I was killed by one of the Taliban and I was the only casualty. I decided to take a look at multiplayer. I took the chance to have some fun with the multiplayer. I was in a place that was pretty hostile to the Taliban, and I decided that I wanted to make it fun for the player.

The game was designed to be a good way of showing off combat experience. It was supposed to be a combat-focused game, and I wanted to show off how well the players could play. The multiplayer was designed to be a nice way to show off that. The game is a multiplayer game, and the game is designed to be a fun and interesting multiplayer game.

3.In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.
The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid's Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.

Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.

Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.

Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. "By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top," said Pérez.

Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.

While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, "We can see, for example, that they have a common 'language,' something like a dialect or dialectic."

Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.

While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, "In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common."

However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. "But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization," said the scientist.






HUMAN TEXT:

1. MONEY, Miss. — Along the edge of Money Road, across from the railroad tracks, an old grocery store rots.
In August 1955, a 14-year-old black boy visiting from Chicago walked in to buy candy. After being accused of whistling at the white woman behind the counter, he was later kidnapped, tortured, lynched and dumped in the Tallahatchie River.
The murder of Emmett Till is remembered as one of the most hideous hate crimes of the 20th century, a brutal episode in American history that helped kindle the civil rights movement. And the place where it all began, Bryant’s Grocery & Meat Market, is still standing. Barely.
Today, the store is crumbling, roofless and covered in vines. On several occasions, preservationists, politicians and business leaders — even the State of Mississippi — have tried to save its remaining four walls. But no consensus has been reached.

Some residents in the area have looked on the store as a stain on the community that should be razed and forgotten. Others have said it should be restored as a tribute to Emmett and a reminder of the hate that took his life.
As the debate has played out over the decades, the store has continued to deteriorate and collapse, even amid frequent cultural and racial reckonings across the nation on the fate of Confederate monuments. At stake in Money and other communities across the country is the question of how Americans choose to acknowledge the country’s past.
“It’s part of this bigger story, part of a history that we can learn from,” said the Rev. Wheeler Parker, 79, a pastor in suburban Chicago and a cousin of Emmett’s who went with him to Bryant’s Grocery that day. “The store should be one of the places we share Emmett’s story.”

2. In this work, we study the internal representations of GANs. To a human observer, a well-trained
GAN appears to have learned facts about the objects in the image: for example, a door can appear on
a building but not on a tree. We wish to understand how a GAN represents such structure. Do the
objects emerge as pure pixel patterns without any explicit representation of objects such as doors and
trees, or does the GAN contain internal variables that correspond to the objects that humans perceive?
If the GAN does contain variables for doors and trees, do those variables cause the generation of
those objects, or do they merely correlate? How are relationships between objects represented?
By carefully examining representation units, we have found that many parts of GAN representations
can be interpreted, not only as signals that correlate with object concepts but as variables that have
a causal effect on the synthesis of objects in the output. These interpretable effects can be used to
compare, debug, modify, and reason about a GAN model. Our method can be potentially applied to
other generative models such as VAEs  and RealNVP.
